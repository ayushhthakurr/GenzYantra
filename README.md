GenzYantra is an assistant app designed for the new generation, combining the words "Genz" (representing the new generation) and "Yantra" (a Hindi word meaning device). It serves as a powerful sound assistant that allows users to interact by speaking and giving commands. The app utilizes the OpenAI API to leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT and DALL-E, enabling it to provide information, generate images, and perform various tasks.

## Features

- **Information Retrieval**: With the integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT, GenzYantra can fetch information on a wide range of topics. It can provide answers to general knowledge queries, provide explanations, and even engage in conversations.

- **Image Generation**: Leveraging the power of OpenAI's DALL-E, GenzYantra can generate images based on user prompts. Whether you need illustrations, visual concepts, or imaginative artwork, the app can help bring your ideas to life.

2. Allow the app to access your device's microphone for voice interaction.

3. Speak clearly and concisely to command GenzYantra or ask questions.

## Special Note: Internal Error

In the event that GenzYantra encounters an internal error and displays the message "An internal error has occurred," please follow the steps below to resolve the issue:

1. **Upgrade your plan**: If you are using a free or basic plan, consider upgrading to a higher tier that offers a larger quota or more generous usage limits. Review the plan details and pricing to determine the best fit for your needs.

2. **Monitor your usage**: Keep track of your API usage and ensure that you stay within the allocated quota. If you have a limit per day, week, or month, pace your usage accordingly to avoid exceeding the quota.

3. **Contact OpenAI support**: If you suspect an error or discrepancy in your quota allocation or have any other issues, it is recommended to reach out to OpenAI support directly. They will provide the necessary assistance to resolve any problems you may be experiencing.

Please note that resolving the internal error may require assistance from OpenAI, as it could be related to technical issues or limitations on their end.
